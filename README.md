## run_analysis.R 
##Instructions 
The run_analysis.R script obtains publically available data from the UCI website and 
manipulates it to produce a single tidy summarized data subset of averaged values for each subject/activity combination.

###Input
Input is data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone as generated by 30 different subjects each undertaking 6 distinct activities in multiple repetition as available at the following URL:

Details of the original experiments are provided here:

There were 561 measures taken for the 10299 instances provided in the raw data.

###Output
The output produced is a summarized dataframe in R which contains a single observation for each unique subject/activity combination with the related measurements of mean and standard deviation averaged to a single value.  [Dimension of 180 rows X 68 columns]

###Parameters
No input parameters are required to run the R script.  

###Libraries Needed
The run_analysis.R requires the dplyr package.
